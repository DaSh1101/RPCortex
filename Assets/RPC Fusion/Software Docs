### Package Manager

#### Local Package Installation
- **Command:** `pkg local "/Users/root/package.pkg"`
  - **Description:** Installs the specified local package. The package will be installed in the `/Packages/` directory using its name. For example, if the package is named "System Info," it will be located at `/Packages/System.Info`.

#### Online Package Installation
- **Command:** `pkg online "System.Info"`
  - **Description:** Connects to an online server and scans the package repository for available packages, provided the device has network access.

#### Package List Update
- **Command:** `pkg list-update`
  - **Description:** Updates the package lists that the system uses for available packages.

#### Online Package Upgrade
- **Command:** `pkg upgrade online "System.Info"`
  - **Description:** Upgrades the specified package to the latest version available in the update list. If no package name is provided, all installed packages will be upgraded to their latest versions.

#### Local Package Upgrade
- **Command:** `pkg upgrade local "System.Info" "/Users/root/system.info.pkg"`
  - **Description:** Upgrades a package using a local file. If an older version exists, it will be removed and replaced with the specified local `.pkg` file.

#### Package Removal
- **Command:** `pkg remove "System.Info"`
  - **Description:** Removes the specified package (e.g., "System.Info") along with its user data if prompted.

#### User Local Data
- **Note:** Developers can create programs that retain essential user data even after upgrades by storing files in the user's "app.data" folder, which is accessible via the RPCortex API.

More documentation will be available soon as the package manager continues to develop.
